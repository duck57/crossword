# Crossword Generator

0.0.1

A tool to generate crossword puzzles.

## Input Format

A tab-separated file in two or three columns:

1. The word
2. The hint
3. [optional] If set to "Optional", "True", "Bonus", or "Extra", the word will not be forcibly included.

## Help Wanted & TODO

* PDF output
* Better [a.k.a. usable] terminal display
* A better [more compact + intersections] word placement algorithm
* Improve documentation/CLI ergonomics
* Write CLI frontend
* Generate from word_search.utils.words (hints needed to be added later manually)
